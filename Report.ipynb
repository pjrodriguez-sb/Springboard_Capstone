    "# Production line Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think if a tell you that we can create a production line simulation? You will ask yourself, why would I need one?How will a simulation help me? For years the companies have been struggling with production lines reaching the daily goal or maximizing the line output. Multiple factors can affect this, but if we have 20 problems that affect this, how can we identify which ones we should work on first? The company doesn't want to spend high resources and time to fix 10% of the problem. It is more objective to identify issues that don't take too long to work with and bring a more significant impact than work with big things that take too long and don't significantly impact the production. We can get a production line simulation that helps to prioritizes concerns, simulates the improvement, and measures its effects for these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the production line simulation the company provide 3 datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cycle time\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset is about the cycle time in seconds of each seven production lines. The cycle time is the total time from the beginning to the end of the process, includes process time, during which a unit is acted upon to bring it closer to an output, and delay time, during which a unit of work in process is spent waiting to take the next action. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Downtime duration\n",
    "\n",
    "Downtime is when a machine is out of action and unavailable for use. The downtime started when the station stopped working for a quality issue, system issues, or the device has a piece broken, and the time stops running until the machine can produce one unit inside the correct quality parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Downtime frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The third dataset is the frequency of downtimes that occur per month and have 24 months collected. The frequency is from each station of all production lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The method to built a production line simulation will be SimPy (https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "*SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python.* SimPy helped to built a simulation of how units looks going through differents stations and being assambled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Cleaning\n",
    "[Cleaning Report](https://github.com/pjrodriguez-sb/Capstone_Project/blob/main/Cleaning_data_1.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem 1 :** The three data set had the production_line and station columns in int format and this could be a problem in future analysis. \n",
    "**Solution:** Convert to object format the 2 columns of the three data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem 2 :** The 3 datasets have the same initial columns but with differents names and will be an issue in futures analysis.  **Solution :** Change the 2 initial columns names to the same that the first one and merge the data to just one datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Link** \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "[EDA Report](https://github.com/pjrodriguez-sb/Capstone_Project/blob/main/Capstone%20Project%20-%20Part_3.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The 3 datasets are skewed to the right, indicating not normal distribution\n",
    "![The three distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjrodriguez-sb/Image-Report/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-02-09%20at%202.22.11%20PM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* I discovered with the downtime frequency data that every first month have a high volume of downtimes and then drop through the year and drop again in December, the last month of the year. This happened because every year, the company shut down in December to do re-layouts, calibration, and maintenance to the machine and then start operating again in January. What is not normal is the difference in downtime volume in 2019 compared to 2018. \n",

    "## 5. Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose SimPy to build a simulation. SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python. Processes in SimPy are defined by Python generator functions and may be used to model active components like customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some simple concept to use in Simpy simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions | Definition\n",
    "--------- | ----------\n",
    "Environment.run() |     Normal simulations use Environment. For real-time simulations, SimPy provides a RealtimeEnvironment\n",
    "simpy.events |  To create events.\n",
    "Event. triggered | If an event gets triggered, it is scheduled at a given time and inserted into SimPy’s event queue.\n",
    "Timeout(delay, value=None) | Let time pass in a simulation.\n",
    "Resource() | Its only parameter – apart from the obligatory reference to an Environment – is its capacity. It must be a positive number.\n",
    "Containers | help you modelling the production and consumption of a homogeneous, undifferentiated bulk.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Simulation Code](https://github.com/pjrodriguez-sb/Springboard_Capstone/blob/main/Simulation_XX.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the simulations is to assemble 600 units at the end of the shift. The first observations are that the standard deviation is so high that the process is merely meeting the daily goal, suggesting that the primary focus should low the standard deviation to mitigate each station's inconsistency and, in this way, normalize the entire line making the process flow improve to meet the demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Future improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the future, I would like to spend more time with the simulation, adding more constrain to see how the process flow behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding constraints helps determine which limitations significantly impact the line and support the management in maximizing the output.\n"
